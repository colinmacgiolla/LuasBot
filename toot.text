There is no Green Line Service this morning due to a technical issue with the overhead power lines. Luas technicians are on site and working to resolve the matter. Luas tickets are valid on Dublin Bus for the duration of this disruption. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. Red Line Services are operating normally. 
All lifts and escalators are in full working order.
