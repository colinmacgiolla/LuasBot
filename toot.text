All Red Line services are operating normally. 
Due to an earlier medical emergency, there are currently delays on the Green line outbound/southbound. Luas tickets are valid on Dublin bus. Apologies for any inconvenience. 
The trackside escalator at Connolly and the lift at Dundrum are currently out of service. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. 
All other lifts and escalators are in full working order.
