Red Line services are currently operating with delays of approx 20 mins between Heuston and Tallaght due to Gardai dealing with ant-social behaviour. Apologies for any inconvenience. 
Green Line services are operating normally. 
Both lifts at Phibsborough and the roadside escalator at Connolly are out of service. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. 
All other lifts and other escalators are in full working order.
