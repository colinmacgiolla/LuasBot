All Red Line services are operating normally. 
There is significant disruption on the Green Line due to a Luas related issue at Sandyford Stop. Luas maintenance and operations are working to resolve the matter. We will update passengers on what tram transport options are available to them shortly. Please be advised tickets are valid on Dublin Bus. 
The lift at Ranelagh is out of service. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. 
All other lifts and escalators are in full working order.
