Luas Green Line trams are running to all stops again, following earlier non Luas related RTA, and are operating with long delays while we regulate our service. Dublin Bus will accept all valid Luas tickets for the duration of this disruption. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. All Red Line services are operating normally. The Cabra Road Lift or the Southbound (Inbound) Lift at Phibsborough will be taken out of service on Wednesday 12th of June and returned to service, on or before, Friday June 21st. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. 
All other lifts and escalators are in full working order.
