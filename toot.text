Passengers, please be advised Green Line services have fully reopened after an earlier technical issue with the overhead power lines. Please expect delays as we work to regulate the line. Thank you for your patience. Red Line Services are operating normally. 
The lift at Connolly is currently out of service. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. 
All other lifts and escalators are in full working order.
