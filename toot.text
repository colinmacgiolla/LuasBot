Passengers, please be advised that Green Line services are back operating with delays due to a bus broken down on the tracks earlier. Please allow additional time for travel as we regulate the service. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. All Red Line services are operating normally. 
All lifts and escalators are in full working order. Passengers travelling to Leopardstown Racecourse, alight at Sandyford for the free shuttle bus service.
