A valid Luas ticket is required to use this service. In addition Dublin Bus are accepting all valid Luas tickets for travel between Red Cow and Saggart. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. 
All Green Line services are operating normally. 
The lift at Balally is out of service. We apologise for any inconvenience caused.
