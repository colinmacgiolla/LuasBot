Service Information: Monday 13th NovemberGreen Line passengers please be advised that due to a fallen tree at Beechwood, there is no Green Line service running from St. 
Stephen’s Green to Balally. In order to remove the tree and ensure the overhead lines are not damaged, we must turn off the power between St. 
Stephen’s Green to Balally. It is estimated that this will take three hours to complete and we hope to resume a full service by 1. 30pm. Services are running from Broombridge / Parnell to St. 
Stephen’s Green and from Balally to Sandyford / Brides Glen only. Luas tickets are valid on Dublin Bus for the duration of the disruption. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. Red Line services have resumed. Expect delays while we regulate the service. Please follow the news / media for travel updates. 
All lifts and escalators are in full working order.
