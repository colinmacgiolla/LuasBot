Red Line trams from Red Cow to The Point are on the move again with delays while we regulate service. Dublin Bus will accept all valid tickets during regulation. We apologise for any inconvenience. 
All Green Line services are operating normally. 
The descending escalator at Connolly and the lift at Dundrum are currently out of service. We apologise for any inconvenience caused. 
All other lifts and escalators are in working order.
