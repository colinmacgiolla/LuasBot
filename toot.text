Storm Éoywn - Service InformationFriday, January 24th Due to Storm Éoywn, there are no Luas Red or Green Line services this morning. Inspections of the Luas lines began at 11:00 AM, with maintenance teams assessing tracks, overhead powerlines, and substations for storm damage. Once these inspections are completed and it is deemed safe, a phased reopening of the Lines will commence. The return to normal service will be gradual, with the aim of restoring full operations by Saturday, January 25th. Should weather conditions improve, services will resume earlier. We are committed to providing updates on our inspections and progress. A special thank you to all Luas employees for their hard work and dedication during this time, especially those who worked overnight and early this morning to help resume services as quickly as possible. We appreciate your understanding and patience. For further updates, please listen to national traffic reports or visit the Travel Updates section of our website.
