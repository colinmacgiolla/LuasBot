Friday, January 24th Red and Green Line Service Suspension Please be advised that there will be no Red and Green Line services on the morning of Friday, January 24th due to Storm Eowyn. Services will resume once we receive clearance regarding weather conditions and after Transdev’s operations and maintenance teams have thoroughly inspected the Luas lines for any storm debris. The return to normal service will be gradual, with the aim of restoring full operations by Saturday, January 25th. If conditions allow, services may resume earlier. Transdev’s Severe Weather Management Plan is now in effect. Passengers and staff are being kept informed of service changes, and Transdev management is collaborating with operational and maintenance teams to ensure key management roles and core ground staff are stationed at or accommodated near Luas depots. This will enable line inspections and the phased restoration of service as soon as it is deemed safe. We appreciate your understanding and patience during this time. Please listen to national traffic and travel updates and keep checking the Luas website and Luas social media channels for further updates.
