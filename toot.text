Friday 24th November Service InformationRed Line services are operating Tallaght / Saggart to Smithfield only. There is no service operating between Smithfield and Connolly / The Point. 
Green Line services are operating Brides Glen to St. 
Stephen's Green only. There is no service operating between St. 
Stephen's Green and Broombridge. We are not operating to the normal timetable due to the events that took place in the City Centre last night. Luas tickets are valid on Dublin bus for the duration on the disruption. An update from Luas - what is currently happening?The fire-damaged Luas is currently being tow pushed from Upper O’Connell Street. The Gardaí and other agencies are assisting Luas maintenance teams with this move. However, there is no power in the overhead lines in this section, so the team is pushing it with another rail vehicle. In addition to the tram tow push, the overhead power lines in the Westmoreland – O’ Connell Street area, which are currently powered off, are significantly damaged and must be replaced. Work has commenced on replacing the Lines. We anticipate the overhead lines may be operable later this evening. 
When the Lines and power are restored, the Luas Red and Green Lines will return to regular service. We apologise for the inconvenience caused. 
All lifts and escalators are in full working order.
