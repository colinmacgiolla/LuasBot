Storm Eowyn - Service InformationFriday, January 24th Please be advised that there are no Luas Red or Green Line services this morning, Friday, January 24th, due to Storm Eowyn. Services will resume once we receive clearance regarding weather conditions and after Transdevâ€™s operations and maintenance teams have conducted a thorough inspection of the Luas lines for any storm debris. The return to normal service will be gradual, with the goal of restoring full operations by Saturday, January 25th. If conditions improve, services may resume earlier. We are committed to keeping you updated on our progress as soon as inspections commence. We would like to thank all Luas employees for their hard work and dedication during this time, particularlythose who worked overnight and in the early hours to help ensure services can resume as soon as possible. We appreciate your understanding and patience during this time. Please listen to national traffic and see the Travel Updates section of our website. Follow @Luas on X and Facebook for updates.
